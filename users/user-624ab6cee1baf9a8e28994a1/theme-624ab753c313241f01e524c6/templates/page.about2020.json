The one issue they faced: finding swimwear that could keep up with their craving for adventure and carbs. The two set out to design a bikini that would accentuate their waist, elongate their legs and never stop them from grabbing that second serving of spaghetti bolognese. They launched the  brand in the summer of 2017 out of the townhouse they lived in during their last year of university, 437 Johnson St.  <br\/><\/p><p>“We are both 5’3 women with curves, big dreams and bigger appetites. We know first hand what works for real women with real bodies. Our goal is to create swimwear that allows women  everywhere to feel their most confident and sexy while never passing up a good snack.”<br\/><\/p><p>- Love Hyla & Adrien<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["163631254770ef06ae-0","163631254770ef06ae-1"],"settings":{}},"1636316386b895cae2":{"type":"spacing","settings":{"background-color":"#ffffff","spacing-value-desktop":20,"spacing-value-mobile":10}},"1636315503ddd1be5e":{"type":"image-with-text","blocks":{"1636315503ddd1be5e-0":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"ABOUT OUR SUITS"}},"1636315503ddd1be5e-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Our suits are designed with your cravings in mind.

This ambition helped her launch her manufacturing facility which specializes in the production of swimwear and lingerie. They have fair wages, mandate safe working conditions and schedule fair working hours.<br\/><br\/>Rita's factory employs all of her family members, and others in the community.
